## 📄 Technical Documentation: SKU Sales Performance Pipeline

**Project Objective:** Transform raw transactional data into a stakeholder-ready monthly performance report with competitive ranking and market share analytics.

### 🛠 The Tech Stack

* **Engine:** DuckDB (OLAP Optimized)
* **Language:** SQL (Advanced Window Functions & CTEs)
* **Output:** Excel / CSV

### 🧠 Architectural Decisions: "Why DuckDB?"

When choosing a tool for this transformation, I prioritized **speed, scalability, and auditability.**

* **In-Process Efficiency:** Unlike PostgreSQL, DuckDB doesn't require a server. It queries the Excel/CSV files directly, meaning the data never has to leave the local environment—a huge plus for data security and setup speed.
* **Analytical Power:** Standard SQL often struggles with complex "pivoting." I leveraged DuckDB’s advanced `FILTER` clause and `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` to calculate grand totals without losing row-level detail (essential for the "Sales Share %" metric).
* **Memory Management:** DuckDB’s columnar storage engine is designed for exactly this: aggregating large amounts of data (OLAP) far more efficiently than row-based engines like SQLite or traditional spreadsheet software.

### 🏗 Data Pipeline Phases

#### 1. Transformation Layer (The Pivot)

I used **Conditional Aggregation** to "bucket" raw transactions into monthly columns. This converted a "long" dataset into a "wide" reporting format.

* *Key Logic:* `SUM(units) FILTER (WHERE month = 1)`

#### 2. Analytical Layer (The Market Share)

To calculate the "Share of Sales," I used **Window Functions**. This allowed me to divide individual SKU performance by the company-wide total in a single pass, avoiding the need for multiple complex joins.

* *Key Logic:* `SUM(jan_sales) OVER ()`

#### 3. Presentation Layer (The "Enchantment")

Data is only useful if it's readable. I implemented a formatting layer using `printf` and `CASE` statements to ensure that:

* Large numbers have **thousands-separators** (e.g., 10,000 vs 10000).
* Percentages are rounded and concatenated with a `%` symbol for **immediate visual clarity.**

### 📈 Scalability Note

While this report was generated for the current dataset, the code is **idempotent**. If the input data scales from 1,000 to 1,000,000 rows, this pipeline will execute with the same logic and high performance, whereas a standard Excel-only approach would likely face significant latency or crashes.
